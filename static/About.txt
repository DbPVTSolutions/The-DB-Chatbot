Who we are:

We are DB Solutions.  
DB Solutions stands at the forefront of educational software, specializing in reservoir fluid property calculations tailored for petroleum engineering students by petroleum engineering students.
We are at the fortunate position of providing a stress-free way to calculate reservoir fluid property using assorted correlations, and we are excited to have you join us on our journey to do so.

DB Solutions aim:
Fluid properties and physical properties of reservoir fluids are crucial for understanding and predicting volumetric behavior in oil and gas reservoirs. Correlations are used to determine these properties, in the absence of experimentally measured properties and laboratory experiments. 
Accurate measurement and computation of fluid and rock properties are prerequisites for optimal oil and gas production. 
Unfortunately, laboratory measurements of petroleum fluid and rock properties are often time-consuming and capital-intensive.
Accurate computational methods are usually preferred to reduce costs and save time. 
The computational methods for estimating these properties often involve long, laborious, and complex correlations.
We have developed a web application, DB Solutions, for seamlessly computing petroleum fluid and rock properties.
DB Solutions is a platform that allows students and other stakeholders to calculate petroleum rock and fluid properties by entering simple input data on the web.
