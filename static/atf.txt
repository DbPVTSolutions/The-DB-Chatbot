The following text will be used to support responses to queries regarding builds and characteristics, as well as future plans and targets.

Main purpose of this build:

The CHatbot provided by DB solutions is a prototype for the next generation industry AI communication tool. 
This build was purposefully for the ATF challenge to demonstrate how efficiently we can use a chatbot to revolutionize education, business, and many more industries specifically a Petroleum Engineering Calculation software in this case.

Our project addresses the challenge of improving communication within educational institutions, businesses, and companies. \
Many times, traditional methods of communication are slow and not very personalized. \
This affects everyone involved in the institution, including staff, students, customers, or citizens.

Research and Development:
We are constantly studying the latest AI technologies, likes of langchain and new open source LLMs to build advanced chatbots. 
These chatbots will understand and respond to users' questions naturally with advanced domain information.

Statistics that support the increasing need of chatbots:

Here are key statistics that illustrate the increasing influence of HR chatbots in the workplace:
13% of HR teams have already adopted chatbots, virtual assistants, or machine learning apps.
62% prefer to use cognitive tools like chatbots to support their personal HR needs.
92% of HR departments recognize the value of chatbots in guiding employees to the information they need.
Gartner predicts that 75% of HR inquiries will be managed by bots or other conversational AI platforms.
The user experience with chatbots is so seamless that 73% of candidates couldnâ€™t recognize whether they were interacting with a bot.
Career sites employing bots to engage with job seekers experience a significant boost, including 95% more leads, 13% more clicks on job requisitions, and 40% more completed job applications.

Why our chatbot build is different:

Reduced AI hallucination: 
AI hallucination occurs when AI generates false or misleading information due to incorrect assumptions or lack of specific data. 
Our build addresses this issue by ensuring accurate data inputs and refining the algorithms to minimize errors.
Personalized interactions:
We'll focus on making the chatbots interact in a personalized way. 
This means tailoring responses to each user's needs and preferences.
Integration with existing systems: 
Our chatbots will seamlessly integrate with the institution's existing systems and platforms. 
This integration will help automate routine tasks and streamline communication processes. 
The Chatbot here has been fully integrated into a full-fledged software that performs complex engineering calculations.
Data Privacy and security: 
We'll implement strong data privacy and security measures to protect users' information and institutional data.

The aim of this build is to meet the criteria for the development of a functional minimum viable product and to aim to build a scaled-down version of our solution. 
With this, there has been an exception of an admin page.

The following are some commercial potential we expect:
1. Cost Savings: Reduced operational costs for institutions through automation of routine tasks and improved efficiency in communication processes.
2. Customer Satisfaction: Higher levels of customer satisfaction resulting from quicker response times, personalized interactions, and enhanced service delivery.
3. Market Differentiation: Institutions adopting AI-powered chatbots can differentiate themselves in the market by offering innovative and efficient communication solutions.
4. User Engagement and Satisfaction: Measure the frequency and duration of user interactions with the chatbots, use generated insights and feedbacks to assess user satisfaction with chatbot interaction.
end.

Future targets and plans of the DB Chatbot are:
1.Convert all input text files into a vector store with the help of langchain for efficient retrival.
2.Create a custom chain of thought memory and retriever to efficiently process prompts like Natural Language computing.
3.Add an admin page or interface for the parent's company or business existing platforms. 
This admin page will display the conversations per user for a 24-hour period, have a backend database to store these conversations for the desired time period of the company, and finally, at the end of the working day, there will be AI-generated graphs and insights into how and what the users are more interested in.
With a company having access to all these, it will capitalize on building and making more user-oriented changes. 
This will greatly multiply the growth of said company.
